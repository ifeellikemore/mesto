# Project: Mesto

Hello there!
My name is Olya. I was born and raised in Siberia, but I live in California now.

I've just started my study as a web developer and this is my third project I created from scratch by myself.
This project is similar to Instagram. You can edit your profile, upload your favorite pictures, and give them likes.

I made this website responsive using HTML, CSS, and I also added a bit of Javascript (I've just started learning it, so you won't see much of JS here yet). I am planning to add some more of JS as I continue with my study.

Hope you like it.
Enjoy :)
